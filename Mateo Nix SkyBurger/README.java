	//Description:
	//Sky Burger is a game from the early 2010s no longer exists, the basic concept is you start 
	//with the bottom bun and stack toppings that randomly fall from the sky, trying 
	//to avoid the top bun that would complete the burger. The game calculates the cost 
	//of the burger given what you have on it, which is your score.
	
	//How to play:
	//Move the burger using the left and right arrows
	//stack the toppings on top of your burger
	//avoid the top buns to continue to grow the burger
	
	//Setup:
	//Have a package that stores your classes called "skyBurger"
	//the files needed are Burger.java, SkyBurger.java, and Topping.java
	//Store your images in a file named "SkyBurgerImages
	
	//sources
